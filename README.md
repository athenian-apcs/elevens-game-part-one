# Elevens Game Part One

In class today, you'll be writing some code to implement the Card and Deck classes for the Elevens game. 

<br />

Add code to [Card.java](src/main/java/Card.java) and [Deck.java](src/main/java/Deck.java) files, and then test your code in the [Tester.java](src/main/java/Tester.java) file. 

## Run your Tester code with:
```shell script
make run
```
